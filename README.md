In this repository is my script of Rev Bayes and the data that I used in my proyect of Comparative Biology II.

The central script is Desmo_dating.rev, where there are the priors and parameters of my analysis.

The data, concatenado_SO.rev is a molecular matrix of 4 genes from 36 phyllostomid species, acquire 
from Rojas et al. 2016.

The tre, ML_tree.tre is a reconstructed tree in RaxML-NG (script: corrida_rax.txt; and partitions: parti.part) 
of the 36 species of the analysis. 


Thanks and enjoy it! ;)
